## Continuous Integration - Build Pipelines
CI is automatic building and testing code everytime someone commits code changes

concept behind CI: code is committed -> built -> tested

Rather than various team members committing their changes and than build, each commit (pull request) triggers a build. So any build issue, if there can be identified early enough.
